    <p id="textAreaTubularity" align="justify" style = "font-size:15px">In this work, we propose a novel satellite-based road detection method that uniquely leverages a Bayesian filter for tubularity-based peak sampling and further refines the extracted structures with graph-cut optimization. By tracking local maxima via our Bayesian filter, we dynamically adjust sampling radii according to road curvature, thus eliminating the reliance on fixed-radius sampling and greatly reducing erroneous detections caused by noise or nearby non-road features. The sampled points form a graph whose edges correspond to minimal geodesic curves in the tubularity space, providing an initial road network hypothesis. Next, we build color-based appearance models for road and background regions, refine the tubularity values accordingly, and repeat the sampling-and-graph construction to iteratively improve the road hypothesis. This iterative framework, centered on a robust, adaptive Bayesian filter and further refined by graph-cut segmentation, effectively handles highly curved roads, suppresses spurious connections, and maintains manageable computational complexity, yielding accurate and robust road extraction across diverse satellite imagery.
