    <p id="textAreaPlane" align="justify" style = "font-size:15px">We propose a fast and robust geospatial object recognition framework for high-resolution satellite imagery, centered on a novel recursive filter that simultaneously suppresses noise and highlights salient regions. We then refine these salient areas by applying a geodesic transformation, after which we use a graph-cut-based segmentation to obtain shape masks for object detection. Finally, any missed objects are recovered via an appearance-based approach, improving overall recall. Experiments reveal that our method efficiently handles large-scale images while achieving high detection accuracy even for targets of varying sizes and orientations.
