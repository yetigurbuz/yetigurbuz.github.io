    <p id="textAreaRoadesic" align="justify" style = "font-size:15px">In this work, we address the problem of merging short precomputed tracklets for long-term multi-target tracking in wide area surveillance. We approach this task by formulating a min-cost flow problem on a directed graph and introducing a novel tracklet association cost, referred to as the roadesic distance, which enforces spatial consistency among the merged tracklets. This cost leverages global traffic flow information from all observed tracklets, implicitly imposing a spatial consistency constraint without explicitly modifying the min-cost flow formulation. As a result, the roadesic distance not only ensures accurate long-term associations but also fills the gaps between the merged tracklets during the interpolation stage. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our approach improves over baseline frameworks—where costs consider only pairwise tracklet relations—and other existing tracklet merging algorithms in terms of both overall tracking performance and track completion. Furthermore, since we do not rely on target intensities, our formulation is particularly beneficial in scenarios where appearance or shape information is unreliable.
