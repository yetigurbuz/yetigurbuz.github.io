    <p id="textAreaShip" align="justify" style = "font-size:15px">We present a two-stage system for inshore ship detection in multispectral satellite images. First, we segment sea–land boundaries using a graph-cut approach, generating a refined mask. Next, we model harbor lines through a unique grouping technique based on a graph-based search, merging nearby and directionally consistent line segments. This piecewise-linear modeling isolates the harbor region from the sea, leaving candidate ship components. Each component is then characterized and classified via shape-based descriptors and a supervised SVM classifier. Experiments confirm our method’s robust performance on diverse ship sizes and shapes in challenging harbor scenarios.
