    <p id="textAreaRoad" align="justify" style = "font-size:15px">In this work, we address the challenge of automatic road detection over large-scale, grayscale wide-area surveillance imagery by proposing two novel approaches. The first approach constructs a road probability map through tubularity estimation and parallel line detection, effectively leveraging the road’s inherent curvilinear structure and parallel edges to score each pixel’s likelihood of belonging to a road. Subsequently, the second approach refines these detections by building a graph over SLIC superpixels and exploiting graph-cut optimization to reconcile large intensity variations, shadows, and discontinuities. Although the tubularity–parallel-line pipeline is notably faster and yields promising recall rates, the graph-cut approach exhibits superior precision—even in mountainous areas—at the expense of higher computational load. Together, these techniques demonstrate robust performance in extracting extensive road networks from high-resolution grayscale imagery, thereby enabling wider surveillance coverage than conventional RGB-based methods while maintaining reliable accuracy and manageable runtime on datasets encompassing tens of thousands of pixels.
