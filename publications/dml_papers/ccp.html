    <p id="textAreaCCP" align="justify" style = "font-size:15px">Bringing a different perspective to deep metric learning (DML) formulation, we formulate it as a chance constrained optimization problem and theoretically show that a contrastive loss based DML objective is a surrogate for the chance constraints. We rigorously convert the initial problem formulation into another form enabling expressing DML as a set intersection problem. The theory suggests a set intersection mechanism yet allows a greedy algorithm via iterative projections. To this end, we also relate the solution of a proxy-based DML approach to one of the supersets to be intersected to obtain the desired solution. As a result, we formally develop a proxy-based method that inherently employs arbitrary number of proxies for better generalization, realizing the mechanism suggested by the theory with a simple, yet effective, algorithm.

We relate DML to feasibility problem of finite chance constraints. We show that minimizer of proxy-based DML satisfies certain chance constraints, and that the worst case generalization performance of the proxy-based methods can be characterized by the radius of the smallest ball around a class proxy to cover the entire domain of the corresponding class samples, suggesting multiple proxies per class helps performance. To provide a scalable algorithm as well as exploiting more proxies, we consider the chance constraints implied by the minimizers of proxy-based DML instances and reformulate DML as finding a feasible point in intersection of such constraints, resulting in a problem to be approximately solved by iterative projections. Simply put, we repeatedly train a regularized proxy-based loss and re-initialize the proxies with the embeddings of the deliberately selected new samples. We apply our method with the well-accepted losses and show the effectiveness with extensive evaluations on 4 popular metric learning benchmarks.";
