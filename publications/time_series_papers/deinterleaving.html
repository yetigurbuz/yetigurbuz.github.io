    <p id="textAreaDeinterleacing" align="justify" style = "font-size:15px">We propose an end-to-end neural framework for blind deinterleaving of multiple radar signals in time series by casting the problem as a min-cost flow. Our method introduces a bi-level optimization that learns an association-cost function to separate interleaved pulse streams—even under missing pulses, strong jitter, and staggered modulation types. Instead of explicitly solving the min-cost flow, we build a self-attention-based architecture and incorporate soft flow constraints via novel penalty terms, leading to a trainable soft min-cost flow model. Extensive experiments on large-scale synthetic and real-world radar data validate the proposed approach, demonstrating superior accuracy compared to conventional histogram-based deinterleaving methods while robustly handling complex PRI patterns.
