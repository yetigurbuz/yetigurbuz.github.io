    <p id="textAreaMosaicing" align="justify" style = "font-size:15px">We propose a real-time video mosaicing approach for planar scenes, leveraging an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) framework inspired by Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). By recursively estimating camera pose alongside 2D landmarks, our method incrementally aligns and merges consecutive frames—even if they are not strictly overlapping—to build a large, seamless mosaic. This probabilistic formulation also accommodates loop closure, adjusting both pose and map uncertainties as new frames arrive. Experiments demonstrate that, although not always matching the precision of offline optimization-based algorithms, the proposed system offers fast, robust results without requiring all images simultaneously, making it particularly suitable for online mosaicing scenarios.
