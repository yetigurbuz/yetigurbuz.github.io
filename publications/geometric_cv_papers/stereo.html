    <p id="textAreaStereo" align="justify" style = "font-size:15px">We present a sparse recursive filtering framework that enables O(1) stereo matching—achieving linear complexity with respect to the image size regardless of the disparity search range. Our key contribution lies in approximating the cost aggregation step on sparse cost volumes, allowing each pixel to adaptively track only a fixed number of disparity candidates. By hierarchically generating and filtering these candidate disparities with an edge-aware recursive filter, we greatly reduce computational redundancy while preserving important disparity discontinuities. We theoretically show that such a mechanism operates in linear time with respect to the image size, thereby delivering O(1) complexity stereo matching. Experimental results on the Middlebury benchmark confirm that our approach runs up to four times faster than state-of-the-art recursive edge-aware filtering methods, with only a minor trade-off in matching accuracy.
