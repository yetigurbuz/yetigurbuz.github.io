    <p id="textAreaOTFLowMatching" align="justify" style = "font-size:15px">We address discrete flow matching for categorical data—an approach that expands the design space beyond discrete diffusion by allowing arbitrary couplings and inner dynamics. Unlike continuous flows, discrete flows rely on stochastic paths, so existing rectification strategies (which minimize path lengths) do not directly apply. We tackle this limitation by introducing a dynamic-optimal-transport (OT) formulation tailored to discrete flows, where we define a cost function based on state dissimilarities and show its equivalence to a Kantorovich form. This equivalence further enables a minibatch optimization strategy, leveraging recent developments in OT algorithms to reduce the total number of transitions between dissimilar states. Conceptually, our discrete flows use convex interpolants—analogous to shortest-path flows in the continuous realm—achieving fewer and more meaningful “jumps” when generating new samples. In addition, we propose a perplexity upper bound for discrete flow models. Unlike continuous flows, which admit density estimation via instantaneous change of variables, the non-deterministic transitions of discrete flows lack a comparable formula. Our perplexity bound addresses this gap, facilitating model evaluation and comparisons with alternative approaches.
